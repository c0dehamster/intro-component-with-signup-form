## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    -   Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
    -   The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   BEM naming convention

### What I learned

This is my first time using BEM for building an actual page. The rules made naming elements and overall markup much easier. I am going to continue using it for future projects.

For this challenge, I had to learn about HTML form element and methods of user input validation. The topic turned out to be quite complex.

### Continued development

I should learn more about regular expressions. They are a great tool for performing tasks involving pattern comparisons, but the syntax of the expressions looks cryptic and confusing. It will take time to get used to.
